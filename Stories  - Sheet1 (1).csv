1,Some mysteries fade with time… but what if time forgets you?,Supernatural Thriller,Thriller,The Man Who Vanished Twice,,ENGLISH,"Arjun Desai was an ordinary software engineer in Mumbai, leading a quiet life with his wife, Aditi. He was punctual, responsible, and had no enemies. That’s why when he went missing one day, it shocked everyone. His phone was found in his office, his bank accounts untouched, and his last known location was his own home. The police investigated, but there was no ransom call, no sign of struggle—just a man who vanished into thin air.
For three years, Aditi tried to move on. The loneliness was unbearable, but she slowly rebuilt her life. Then, on a stormy night, her doorbell rang. When she opened it, she gasped. Arjun stood there, soaking wet, looking exactly as he had on the day he disappeared—same clothes, same neatly combed hair, and most terrifyingly, the same confused expression.
Aditi broke down in tears, hugging him, but when she pulled back, she noticed something strange. His skin was ice-cold. ""Where have you been?"" she asked. Arjun shook his head. ""I... don’t know. I remember leaving for work, and now I’m here.""
The police were baffled. No one knew what happened. His medical tests were normal, except his body showed no signs of aging. It was as if time had frozen for him. But before any answers could be found, he vanished again—this time, forever.
Desperate, Aditi checked the CCTV footage outside their apartment. What she saw made her blood run cold. At exactly 11:57 PM, Arjun had stepped out onto the street… and then, in a blink, he was gone. No running, no struggle. Just gone.
Weeks later, Aditi received an email from Arjun’s account. It had no subject, no body—only an attachment. When she opened it, it was a video of her sleeping. The timestamp? 11:57 PM… tomorrow night.

2,Some whispers warn you.

The only problem? Every night at exactly 2:33 AM, they heard whispers in the corner of their bedroom.
At first, they ignored it, thinking it was the neighbors. But as the nights passed, the whispers became clearer, almost as if someone was standing right next to them. ""Rhea…"" it would say. ""Meenal…"" The voice was faint, distant, yet chillingly personal.
One night, Rhea recorded the sounds. The next morning, she played it back, expecting to hear muffled noises. Instead, a distorted voice whispered: ""Get out before it wakes up.""
Shaken, the girls decided to sleep in the living room. But that night, Meenal woke up screaming, her arms scratched and bleeding. ""Something grabbed me,"" she sobbed. They packed their bags and left the next morning.
A few days later, Rhea met their landlord, an old man with sunken eyes. When she mentioned the whispers, he went pale. ""The previous tenant… he disappeared in that room. One night, he just vanished. The only thing left was his phone, still recording. It caught his last words—‘It’s coming for me.’""
Rhea deleted the recording and never looked back. To this day, that apartment remains empty. No one stays past the first month.

3,Reality is a memory they chose for you.,Sci-Fi Thriller,Sci-Fi,The Forgotten Experiment,,ENGLISH,"Dr. Karthik Iyer, a neuroscientist, was working on a classified project involving artificial memory implantation. The goal was simple—help patients with dementia regain lost memories. But one night, something went wrong.
Karthik woke up in a different apartment. His furniture, his clothes, even his family was unfamiliar. ""Morning, darling,"" a woman said, kissing his forehead. He stiffened. ""Who... who are you?"" She laughed, assuming he was joking.
Panicked, he checked his phone. The photos were of him with this woman and two kids—children he had no memory of. He ran out, reaching his lab, only to find that his keycard didn’t work. His office had been reassigned. His colleagues didn’t recognize him. It was as if he had never existed.
That night, he found a single file on his laptop, titled ""You are the experiment."" Shaking, he clicked it. A video played. It was himself, speaking. ""Karthik, if you’re seeing this, they wiped your memory. You weren’t supposed to test it on yourself, but you did. You’re trapped in a fabricated life. Escape now.""
He slammed the laptop shut. His so-called ""wife"" walked in. ""Everything okay, honey?"" she asked, her eyes too… calculated. Too knowing. That’s when Karthik realized—this wasn’t his life. And if he stayed, he might never get his real one back.

4,"Some letters arrive late, but love never truly fades.",Romance Drama,Romance,The Last Letter,,ENGLISH,"Ramesh, a retired postman, had delivered thousands of letters in his career. It was a job he took great pride in—connecting people, delivering news, sometimes happiness, sometimes sorrow. After retiring, he lived alone in a quiet corner of the city, his only company being an old radio and his cat, Pillu. One day, while sorting through a dusty old bag in his attic, he found an envelope that had never been delivered. It was yellowed with age, the ink slightly smudged, but still legible. The date on it? December 12, 1979.
His heart sank. A letter undelivered meant a message never received. He couldn’t help but wonder: had it contained something important? A job offer? A final farewell? An apology? The thought of someone waiting decades for a letter that never arrived haunted him. Determined, he wiped the dust off, put on his old postman’s uniform for nostalgia, and decided to find the recipient.
After some searching, he found her—Sneha, an old woman now living in a small house near Marine Drive. When he knocked on her door and introduced himself, she looked confused at first. But when he handed her the letter, she gasped. Her fingers trembled as she traced the handwriting. ""This… this is Aditya’s handwriting,"" she whispered, eyes welling up.
She slowly opened the envelope, carefully unfolding the fragile paper. As she read, tears streamed down her face. ""I love you. If you love me too, meet me at the railway station on December 15, 1979. If you don’t, I will never bother you again,"" the letter read. She clutched it to her chest and let out a choked sob.
Ramesh sat beside her, unsure of what to say. Finally, she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I was there. I waited for hours. He never came.""
Determined to uncover the truth, Ramesh did some digging. He found an old newspaper article from December 15, 1979. His heart ached as he read the words: ""Young man killed in a tragic accident on his way to the station. Identified as Aditya Mehra.""
When he told Sneha, she let out a deep sigh, her gaze distant. ""All these years, I thought he had changed his mind. That he never really loved me. But he… he was coming to me.""
For days after that, she sat by her window, reading and rereading the letter, whispering, ""I waited, Aditya. I waited."" Ramesh left with a heavy heart, but he had given her closure—something she had unknowingly craved for decades.
That night, Sneha passed away in her sleep, the letter clutched tightly in her hands. Some say she died of old age, others say of heartbreak. But Ramesh liked to believe that, finally, Aditya had come for her—this time, not in a letter, but in spirit.

5,"Sometimes, the best love stories start with a prank",Comedy- Romance,Romance,The Great Fake Date Disaster,,ENGLISH,"Rahul had always been the shy guy in his group. While his friends went on multiple dates, he was the one third-wheeling, making awkward jokes, and pretending he wasn’t lonely. Tired of his sad love life, his friends took matters into their own hands and set him up on a blind date. ""She’s perfect for you,"" they promised. ""Just don’t be weird.""
Nervous but excited, Rahul arrived at the café early. He rehearsed possible conversation starters in his head: Do I talk about movies? Books? Oh god, what if she hates my jokes? He wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans just as a woman approached him hesitantly.
""Are you Rahul?"" she asked, tilting her head.
""Yes!"" he said a little too loudly. ""I mean… yeah. That’s me.""
The woman sighed in relief and sat down. ""I have a confession. My brother set me up for this. As a prank.""
Rahul blinked. ""Wait. My friends did the same thing.""
For a second, they just stared at each other, and then—laughter. Loud, uncontrollable laughter. People at the café turned to look, but neither of them cared. ""So basically, we’re two losers who got pranked into a fake date?"" she chuckled.
""Yup,"" Rahul grinned. ""Might as well make it fun.""
And fun it was. They talked about everything—movies, music, embarrassing childhood stories. Turns out, she loved Marvel, and he was a die-hard DC fan. ""Marvel has better storytelling,"" she argued. ""Excuse me, have you even seen The Dark Knight?"" he countered. They debated, teased each other, and ended up ordering the same coffee without realizing it.
As the evening went on, Rahul forgot all about the prank. It didn’t feel like a fake date anymore. It felt… real. And he liked it. ""You know,"" he said hesitantly, ""this might be the best prank my friends have ever played on me.""
She smirked. ""Agreed. But if we tell them we had fun, they’ll think they won. We can’t let that happen.""
""Absolutely not,"" Rahul grinned. ""So, what do we do?""
""Simple,"" she said. ""We tell them it was a disaster, never speak to each other again in front of them, and then—"" she took his phone and saved her number ""—we secretly meet up for an actual date.""
Rahul’s heart did a little happy dance. ""Oh, I like the way you think.""
When he met his friends later, they bombarded him with questions. ""How was it?"" ""Did she run away?"" ""Tell us everything!""
Rahul shook his head dramatically. ""Terrible. Worst date ever. I tripped on my way in, spilled coffee on her, and she called me a loser.""
His friends burst into laughter, patting his back in sympathy. Meanwhile, his phone buzzed under the table. A message from her:
""Same lie here. Next Friday, 7 PM? And this time, no pranks.""
Rahul smiled. Maybe, just maybe, his dating luck had finally changed.

6,Reality updated. But who’s behind the code?,Techno-Thriller ,Thriller,The Glitch in Reality,,ENGLISH,"Aryan was a software engineer, the kind who thrived on logic, algorithms, and facts. So when he started noticing glitches in reality, he thought he was going crazy.
It started small—déjà vu that lasted too long, objects shifting places when he wasn’t looking, his phone showing calls from numbers that didn’t exist. He brushed it off as stress.
Then, one morning, he woke up to find two notifications on his phone.
1. ""Your world has been reset.""
 2. ""Do not resist the update.""
Aryan frowned. Was this some kind of prank? He checked the sender. No source. Just empty space.
Confused, he got out of bed—only to freeze. His mirror reflected a different version of him. His hair was shorter. The scar on his forehead—one he had since childhood—was gone.
His heart pounded. He checked his phone again. The second notification had changed.
""We are fixing the inconsistency.""
Suddenly, his room flickered. For a brief second, everything—his bed, his walls, even his own hands—glitched. Like pixels breaking apart.
That’s when it hit him.
He wasn’t in the real world.
He grabbed his laptop and frantically searched for any signs of an anomaly. He dug deep into system logs, tracking his location data. What he found made his skin crawl.
His entire existence had been rewritten. His birth records were altered. His college degree—different. His old photos? Some were missing. Some were changed.
Panic set in. He called his best friend, Ananya. ""Something’s wrong with reality,"" he blurted.
Silence. Then, in a robotic tone, Ananya responded: ""You are not supposed to know.""
The call disconnected.
Aryan’s room flickered again. This time, it didn't stop. His walls began dissolving, his floor breaking apart into glowing lines of code. His body felt lighter, transparent.
A new notification flashed on his screen.
""Final reboot in progress. Thank you for participating.""
Aryan screamed as the world around him erased itself.
And then—he woke up.
Everything was normal. His room intact. His phone—no weird messages. He exhaled in relief. ""Must've been a nightmare,"" he muttered.
But then, his phone buzzed. A notification.
""Welcome back, Aryan. The update was successful.""
His blood ran cold.

7,The house knows your name… and it’s waiting.,Paranormal Thriller ,Thriller,The Whispering Shadows,,ENGLISH,"Rohan had never believed in ghosts. As a journalist, he had spent years debunking paranormal myths, exposing fake tantriks, and writing columns about how the human mind plays tricks. But when he received a letter about a haunted house in Himachal Pradesh, something about it felt different.
The letter came from an old man named Dev Bhandari, who claimed his ancestral home had been cursed for decades. ""It whispers to us,"" the letter read. ""It knows our names.""
Rohan smirked as he packed his bags. ""Another superstitious villager,"" he thought. He loved these cases—easy stories, quick trips, and a paycheck.
When he arrived, the house stood in eerie silence. It was a massive, ancient mansion, nestled between towering pine trees. Despite the cold, sweat formed on Rohan’s back. Something about the air felt... wrong.
Dev Bhandari greeted him at the gate. ""You shouldn't have come at night,"" he muttered. His eyes darted toward the house, as if afraid to look at it too long.
Rohan waved off his warning. ""So, tell me, what's the big mystery?""
Dev hesitated before speaking. ""Every night, we hear whispers. They come from the walls, the ceilings, the floors. And they say our names.""
Rohan raised an eyebrow. ""You hear your name being whispered?""
""Yes. And sometimes… the whispers answer us.""
Rohan laughed. ""Let’s see how real these whispers are."" He set up his recording equipment in the main hall and waited. Hours passed. Nothing. Just the ticking of a rusted clock.
At exactly 2:13 AM, the air turned ice-cold. A deep, slow creak echoed through the house. Rohan grabbed his flashlight.
Then, he heard it.
""Rohan.""
His breath hitched. It was soft—barely more than a sigh—but unmistakable. It came from the wall right beside him.
He turned sharply, pressing his ear against the old wooden panels. Silence. Then—
""Rohan… why are you here?""
His blood ran cold. He stumbled backward. The whisper wasn't an echo. It was a response.
Suddenly, the old chandelier overhead swung violently, as if shoved by invisible hands. The doors slammed shut. The whispers grew louder.
""You shouldn't have come.""
Rohan bolted. He yanked the doors open, only to find Dev Bhandari staring at him. But Dev’s eyes… weren’t normal. They were glassy, unfocused. His lips moved, but the voice that came out wasn’t his own.
""You ignored the warning. Now the house knows you.""
A sudden gust of wind snuffed out all the candles. And in the pitch darkness, the whispers laughed.
Rohan fled that night, never looking back. The next morning, when he checked his recording… The whispers were still there.
And they said his name.

Then, while sorting through his father’s old belongings, he found a diary. Inside was a note written years ago:
 
""Life is a book, son. Some chapters are painful, some are beautiful. But never stop writing. The best pages are yet to come.""
 
At that moment, Rohan understood. His journey wasn’t over. He wasn’t just carrying responsibilities—he was carrying a legacy. With a deep breath, he turned the page…

9,"Even in the darkest shadows, a single light can save you.",Psychological Horror ,Horror,"The Shadow’s Whisper
",,ENGLISH,"Aniket had always been uncertain. Every decision—whether picking a flower for a bouquet or choosing a path in life—left him frozen. He worked at Blossom, the small flower shop his father had built with love, but love was something Aniket had never quite felt for himself. The city outside pulsed with life, but inside, he felt empty. His thoughts were a constant loop of “What if I fail?”, “What if I’m not enough?”
One scorching afternoon, seeking relief from the shop’s suffocating walls, he walked across a bridge. The sun cast long shadows, and that’s when he noticed it. The man ahead of him had a shadow that moved... but not like normal shadows. It twisted, its edges writhing unnaturally. Then—it spoke.Aniket’s stomach clenched. He blinked, sure he was imagining it. But then—his own shadow whispered. ""You’re nothing, Aniket."" He stiffened. The voice was low, venomous. He looked down. His shadow stretched long, lips curling into a sneer.
 
""You should have never been born.""
 
His breath turned shallow. He turned to leave, but his shadow—it didn’t follow. It stayed. Watching.
The Descent
The whispers didn’t stop. Every moment, every corner, the shadow was there. Lurking. Watching. Growing.
 
""You don’t belong here."" ""You’re a mistake.""
 
He stopped looking at mirrors. Stopped going out unless he had to. Blossom became his only refuge, but even among the flowers, the words still echoed.
 
Then one night, as he locked the shop, he saw it. The shadow was no longer beneath him.
It stood across the street, taller, darker. Smiling. And then—it stepped forward.
The Final Choice
 
Aniket ran. His feet pounded against the pavement, heart hammering. Neon lights blurred past, the city roaring around him. But the shadow followed, its whispers turning into screams.
 
He found himself on the bridge. The wind howled. The river below was black, stretching into nothingness.
 
The shadow stood at the edge now. Waiting. It lifted a hand and pointed downward.
""End it.""

Aniket’s legs trembled. Maybe it was right. Maybe he was just... nothing. He stepped closer.
Then—a flicker of white. A flower.
A single white lily, clinging to the rusted railing, its petals bruised but still standing. Aniket stared. His breath steadied. If a fragile flower could hold on, so could he. ""No.""
The shadow flinched.
He took a step back. Then another.
 
It screamed. It shrieked, writhing, shrinking, curling into itself. Until it was gone. The Aftermath
The next morning, Aniket stood outside Blossom, staring at the ""Open"" sign.
 
The world hadn’t changed. The city still rushed, the doubts still lingered. But for the first time, he knew—
 
They didn’t control him anymore. And that was enough.

He was five minutes late. The professor stood at the door, arms crossed. Before Rahul could explain, the professor said, ""Take your seat. Someone called ahead and explained why you were late.""
 
After the exam, Rahul saw the old man sitting on a bench. ""Did you...?"" Rahul asked. The man smiled. ""I know your professor. I made the call.""

Every conversation felt like a battlefield. What if I say something wrong? What if they leave me? So, she stayed quiet, swallowing her thoughts and emotions, smiling on the outside but breaking on the inside.
 
One night, after a gathering with friends, she sat alone in her room, tears streaming down her face. She had wanted to speak—about her dreams, her fears, even the small joke she thought was funny. But the fear of losing people had kept her silent again.
 
Just then, a message popped up on her phone from her best friend, Riya: ""Aanya, why are you always so quiet? We miss hearing your thoughts.""
Her fingers trembled as she typed back: ""I’m scared if I say something wrong, I’ll lose everything.""
 
A pause. Then Riya replied: ""Aanya, real friends don’t leave because of words. But if you stay silent forever, you’ll lose yourself.""
 
Something clicked. That night, Aanya stood in front of the mirror, looking at her teary-eyed reflection. Her curls were messy, just like her mind, but they were beautiful in their chaos. Maybe, just maybe, her thoughts were too.
 
The next day, she spoke. Not much, just a little. But for the first time, she didn’t feel like she was losing something. She felt like she was finally gaining herself.
 
Staying silent out of fear doesn’t protect you—it only cages you. The right people will love you for who you truly are, not for the words you do or don’t say.

19,You can’t pour from an empty cup—take care of yourself too.,Motivational Drama,Drama,The Empty Cup,,ENGLISH,"Neha was the one everyone relied on—always listening, always helping, always putting others first. She believed love meant sacrifice, so she never said no. But over time, exhaustion crept in. She felt invisible, drained, as if she was giving away pieces of herself, leaving nothing behind.
 
One evening, as she helped her grandmother with tea, the elderly woman handed Neha a full cup and said, “Pour this into another cup.”
 
Neha did.
 
“Now keep pouring,” her grandmother instructed.
 
Neha tilted the cup, but not a single drop remained. “There’s nothing left,” she sighed.
 
Her grandmother smiled knowingly. “Exactly, beta. If you never refill your cup, how will you keep giving?”

The words struck deep. For the first time, Neha saw herself—not just as a giver but as someone who also needed care, rest, and love. That night, she made a decision. She would still give, but not at the cost of losing herself.
 
The next day, she did something she had never done—she said no without guilt. And instead of feeling selfish, she felt lighter, stronger.
Giving is beautiful, but you can’t pour from an empty cup. Fill yours first.

20,Stop seeking approval—your worth has always been within you.,Finding Self-Worth,Drama,The Mirror’s Truth,,ENGLISH,"Aarohi had spent her entire life chasing approval—always measuring her worth through the eyes of others. She dressed to impress, made choices that pleased her family, and shaped her dreams according to what society expected. But deep inside, she felt like a stranger in her own life.
 
One evening, exhausted from pretending, she walked into the attic and found an old, dusty mirror. She stared at her reflection, searching for answers. Frustrated, she whispered, “Who am I?”
 
At that moment, a tiny crack appeared on the mirror’s surface. Aarohi gasped, stepping back. Then, as if the mirror itself had come to life, a soft yet firm voice echoed:
 
""You’re asking the wrong person.""
 
A shiver ran down her spine. She had always sought answers outside herself—waiting for someone to tell her she was enough, she was beautiful, she was worthy. But the truth had always been within her.
 
Tears welled up in her eyes, but for the first time, they weren’t of sadness. They were of realization.
 
That day, she stopped asking the world for validation. She stopped waiting for permission to be herself. Instead, she looked into the mirror—not for approval, but for acceptance.
 
The next morning, she did something she had never done before—she made a choice just for herself. And as she walked away, the cracked mirror stood still, reflecting not a broken girl, but a woman finally whole.
Your worth isn’t in others’ eyes—it’s in your own. Stop seeking approval and start embracing yourself.

Days later, Arjun collapsed in the field. Weak and frail, he held Rohan’s hand and said, ""Promise me you'll never stop studying. It's your way out of this life.""
 
Years later, Rohan returned to the village as a doctor. He opened a free clinic, treating the poor with compassion. When asked why, he simply said, ""My father taught me that true wealth isn’t in what you have, but in what you give.""

Vikram froze. His briefcase slipped from his hand. ""Why would you ask that?"" he whispered.
 
Aryan’s eyes filled with tears. ""Because you’re always too busy. I thought maybe if I paid you, you’d have time for me.""
 
Vikram’s heart shattered. He knelt down, tears brimming in his eyes. ""You don’t have to buy my time… You already have it.""
 
The next day, Vikram canceled his meetings. He took Aryan to the park, flew kites with him, and laughed for the first time in years. That night, Vikram tucked Aryan into bed and whispered, ""From now on, you’ll always have my time.""
 
Years later, Aryan became a successful motivational speaker. In a packed hall, he said, ""My father taught me a priceless lesson — money can’t buy love, but love makes time priceless.""
 
As Vikram sat in the front row, tears in his eyes, Aryan smiled and said, ""Thank you for giving me the gift of your time, Baba.""
 
At that moment, Vikram knew the greatest investment he had ever made wasn’t in business
— it was in his son.

28,Behind every 'No' is a love story you haven't heard yet—listen before you judge.,Mother-Daughter Bond,Drama,The Unsent Letter,,ENGLISH,"Ananya had always felt that her mother, Neeta, was too strict. While her friends stayed out late, traveled, and made their own choices, Ananya was always met with boundaries. ""No, it’s not safe."" ""Be home by 8."" ""I need to know where you are.""
 
Ananya hated it. ""Why can’t you trust me, Maa?"" she would ask. ""I just want you to be safe,"" Neeta would reply softly.
One evening, Ananya’s friends invited her to a late-night party. When she asked her mother, Neeta immediately said no. ""You don’t need to be out that late.""
 
Furious, Ananya shouted, ""You don’t trust me! You don’t care about me!""
 
Neeta’s face fell. Without saying a word, she turned and walked away. The silence that followed stung more than the argument itself.

Later that night, restless and still angry, Ananya opened an old drawer in her mother’s room, searching for some papers. Amidst the clutter, she found a worn-out envelope labeled ""To Ananya"" in her mother’s handwriting. Curious, she opened it.
 
""Ananya,
If you’re reading this, it means you’ve grown up enough to wonder why I’m so protective. I’m not perfect, but I’m trying to protect you the only way I know how — because I lost my own mother too soon. When I was your age, I begged my mother to let me go on a trip with my friends. She finally agreed. That was the last time I saw her — there was an accident on her way to pick me up. I blamed myself for years. I’m scared of losing you the same way I lost her. Maybe I’ve held you too tightly because I’m terrified of letting you go.""
 
Tears blurred Ananya’s vision as she finished reading. Her heart clenched. She had accused her mother of not trusting her, but now she understood — her mother wasn’t controlling her; she was protecting her from the fear of loss.
 
Ananya quietly walked to her mother’s room. Neeta was sitting at the edge of the bed, eyes downcast. Ananya sat beside her and placed the letter in her mother’s hand.
 
""I’m sorry, Maa,"" Ananya whispered. Neeta’s eyes filled with tears. ""You read it?""
Ananya nodded. ""I didn’t know… why didn’t you tell me?""
 
Neeta stroked her hair gently. ""Because some wounds are easier to bear in silence.""
 
Ananya took her mother’s hand. ""You don’t have to carry that pain alone anymore. I understand now.""
 
Neeta smiled through her tears. ""You don’t have to understand everything. Just know that I love you.""
 
From that day on, their relationship changed. Neeta slowly learned to let go, and Ananya began to see her mother not as overprotective, but as someone who had endured loss and still managed to love fiercely.
 
 Sometimes, a mother’s protectiveness is rooted in a past you don’t know — understanding brings healing.

Slowly, Riya started opening up. She told Neha about her anxiety, her fear of public speaking, and how hard it was to trust people. ""You can trust me,"" Neha had promised. They became inseparable — studying together, laughing, and sharing their secrets.
 
During exams, they worked hard, motivating each other. On the result day, Riya topped the class, while Neha came second. Neha congratulated Riya, but deep down, jealousy began to burn.
 
One day, Neha sat with her popular group and casually said, ""You know, Riya’s not as confident as she seems. She panics before every exam and hates speaking in public.""

That night, Neha couldn’t sleep. The guilt weighed heavily on her. The next morning, she stood up in class. ""I need to say something,"" Neha said. ""I betrayed Riya’s trust, and I’m sorry. She trusted me with her fears, and I used them against her. That was wrong.""
 
Riya’s eyes widened. After class, Neha approached her. ""I know I messed up. I don’t expect you to forgive me… but I miss my friend.""
 
Riya paused, then said softly, ""Trust is hard to rebuild. But maybe we can start with honesty."" Neha smiled. ""Deal.""

The next day, Karan and the group invited Aryan to a party. ""Bring some cash — we need drinks,"" Karan said. Aryan hesitated but went along, handing over the money his parents had given him for books.

Furious and humiliated, Aryan left the party. He sat alone at the park, tears stinging his eyes. He pulled off the expensive sneakers and stared at them. They didn’t make him feel cool — they made him feel used.
 
The next day, Aryan returned the sneakers and bought the books he needed. Karan and his group ignored him at school. Aryan sat alone until another boy, Rohan, sat next to him.
 
""You don’t need to impress anyone to be liked,"" Rohan said. ""Real friends don’t need you to prove anything.""
 
Aryan smiled. He had learned the hard way — true friendship isn’t bought, it’s earned.
 
 Friendship built on pressure and pretenses will fade — real friends accept you for who you are.

An old man sat down next to him. His face was weathered, his eyes sharp. ""Rough night?"" the man asked.

He folded the letter neatly, placed it on his desk, and reached for the sleeping pills. Just as he opened the bottle, a strong wind blew through the window, knocking the letter onto the floor. Annoyed, he bent down to pick it up—only to see another letter underneath it.
Confused, he opened it. It was his own handwriting, but the words weren’t his. It was a letter from his future self, telling him that life gets better, that happiness was waiting just around the corner.
His hands trembled. How was this possible? He looked around the room, heart racing. The pills slipped from his grip. That’s when his phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number:

Tears filled his eyes. He put the sleeping pills back in the drawer and picked up his phone. His best friend’s name glowed on the screen. With a deep breath, he pressed call.
""Hey… can we talk?"" he asked, voice shaking.
""Of course, man,"" came the reply.

The sound of the starting gun echoed, and he launched forward, feeling the adrenaline surge through his veins. But something was wrong. His legs felt heavier than usual, his breathing was uneven.

That night, he sat alone in the empty stadium, staring at the track that had been his entire world. His coach’s words echoed in his mind: “Hard work never fails.”
He clenched his fists, staring at the ground. If hard work never fails… then why did I?

Her mother entered the room, looking at the untouched dinner on Aisha’s table. “Maybe you should try something different,” she suggested.
Aisha wanted to argue, but instead, she just whispered, ""If passion is enough to succeed, then why do so many dreams go unnoticed?""

38,"Some letters are never answered, but the silence speaks volumes",Unspoken Bonds & The Complexity of Love,Drama,The Letter That Never Came,,ENGLISH,"Every Sunday, Kabir sat by his window and wrote a letter to his father. He told him about school, his cricket matches, the friends he made, and the moments he wished they could share. His father worked abroad, promising to reply whenever he had time.
Weeks turned into months. Months turned into years. But the replies never came. Still, Kabir kept writing.
When he graduated, he wrote about his college acceptance letter. When he won his first match, he wrote about how much he wished his father had been there to see it. When he got his first job, he wrote about how he wanted to make his father proud.
Then one day, he stopped.
The ink in his pen ran dry, but that wasn’t the real reason. Something in him had changed. He sat by his window, looking at the untouched stack of letters, wondering:
If people truly care, do they always show it?

39,"When life presses pause, sometimes the most important moments begin.",Sacrifice & The Pause of Life,Drama,The Clock That Stood Still,,ENGLISH,"Maya had always been a planner. She had mapped out her entire life—her dream college, her ideal job, the city she would move to, the milestones she would achieve. She believed that if she followed the plan, nothing could go wrong.
Then her father fell sick. At first, it was just a few doctor visits. Then it turned into hospital stays, medical bills, sleepless nights. College applications sat untouched. Job offers were turned down. One by one, her plans faded into the background as she took care of the man who had once taken care of her.
One evening, as she sat by his bedside, she noticed the wall clock. It had stopped at 3:47. She stared at it for a long time. It was working fine just this morning.
She sighed and leaned back in her chair, exhaustion settling in. She had always believed time never waited for anyone. But now, looking at that frozen clock, she wondered:
If time never waits for anyone, then why does life sometimes force us to pause?

But life had its way of pulling them in different directions. Sameer moved to a new city for college. Rishi got busy with work. At first, they tried to stay in touch—weekly calls turned into monthly ones, then into the occasional forwarded meme. And then, nothing.
One evening, as Sameer scrolled through his contacts, he saw Rishi’s name. He stared at it for a while, debating whether to call. But something stopped him. It had been years. Would it be awkward? Would they even have anything to talk about?
His finger hovered over the screen before he finally tapped delete.
As the name disappeared, a thought lingered in his mind:
If some bonds are meant to last, why do they fade so easily?

41,"If effort guarantees success, then why do some dreams remain out of reach?",Perseverance & The Reality of Effort,Drama,Aarav and his dramatic future,,ENGLISH,"Aarav had always been an average student, but his dream was anything but ordinary. Cracking the JEE exam and securing a seat in a top engineering college—that was his goal. While others took breaks, he spent every waking moment buried in books. Fourteen hours a day, seven days a week. Sleep was a luxury, distractions were the enemy.
Yet, no matter how hard he tried, his scores never improved. Mock test after mock test, failure greeted him like an old friend. His classmates moved ahead, but he remained stuck in the same loop of disappointment.
His only solace was Meera. She wasn’t just his classmate—she was his anchor. She never let him sink under the weight of self-doubt. “You’re more than just a score, Aarav,” she would remind him. “You have the dedication most people only dream of. If not this time, then the next. Just don’t stop trying.”
Encouraged by her words, he gave himself one last chance. Another year. Another attempt. Another cycle of relentless effort. He cut himself off from everything—friends, hobbies, even sleep. His books became his world. But when the results came, history repeated itself. He had failed again.
He stared at the screen, his vision blurring. It wasn’t disappointment anymore—it was something deeper. Something he couldn’t name.
Meera held his hand, her voice soft yet firm. “You gave it everything, Aarav. Every single thing.”
He nodded, but a question gnawed at him.
If hard work and dedication weren’t enough… then what was?

The compartment was nearly empty, except for a man in a hooded jacket sitting by the window.  He sat opposite him, plugging in his earphones. The train rattled forward. The man stared at him. No movement. No blinking. Just staring.  Aarav felt uneasy but ignored it. Minutes passed. The train entered a dark tunnel. The lights flickered.  When the lights came back, the man was now sitting beside him. Aarav’s breath caught. How did he move so fast?  “Are you okay?” Aarav finally asked, his voice shaky.  The man turned. His face was pale, hollow. His lips barely moved— ""No one ever asks that.""  The train screeched to a stop. The lights flickered again. When they came back—  *The seat beside him was empty.*  Aarav’s heart pounded. He looked around—only a newspaper lay on the empty seat.  His eyes widened as he read the headline:  *""Man jumps in front of train—unnoticed by anyone.""*  The date? *Yesterday.*  The train started moving again. Aarav sat frozen, staring at the empty seat.  A whisper brushed his ear—  ""I just wanted someone to notice...""  
*Moral:* Sometimes, the loneliest souls are the ones sitting right next to us. Notice them before it's too late.

It wasn’t just a passion; it was his life. While others played for fun, he played with purpose. He woke up before dawn every day, ran till his legs ached, practiced till his hands blistered, and studied every game like a puzzle waiting to be solved.
Yet, every selection trial ended the same way—“Not selected.”
People told him, “Maybe you’re not good enough.” But Aryan didn’t believe in ‘maybe.’ He trained harder, stayed longer at the nets, sacrificed birthday parties, friendships, and even sleep. He poured his entire soul into the game.
Another year, another trial. He walked in with confidence, gave his best, but when the final list was announced… his name wasn’t on it. Again.
That night, Aryan sat on the empty cricket field, staring at the sky. He had done everything right. He had given his all. Still, it wasn’t enough.
He clenched his fists, trying to silence the voice in his head whispering—Maybe talent really does matter more than hard work. Maybe dreams aren’t for everyone.
But then again… is giving up ever an option?

44,"If some bonds are never meant to break, why do we let silence build the distance?",Friendship & The Passage of Time,Drama,The Bridge Between Us,,ENGLISH,"Zara and Ayaan had been inseparable for ten years. Their bond was effortless—late-night conversations, inside jokes, and a promise that they would always be there for each other.
Then, life happened.
Different colleges, different schedules, missed calls that were never returned. They never had a fight, never had a reason to stop talking—it just… happened. The silence between them stretched longer, like an invisible wall growing thicker with time.
One evening, Zara was at a café, scrolling through old photos when her heart skipped a beat—Ayaan was sitting across the room, laughing with some friends.
For a brief second, their eyes met. A thousand memories flashed between them. She almost smiled. Almost waved. But before she could, he looked away, as if she was just another stranger.
Zara felt something sink inside her. Should she walk up to him? Say something? Fix what had broken?
She took a deep breath… and walked past him.
As she stepped outside, a cold wind hit her face, and a thought crossed her mind—if some friendships never truly end, then why do we act like they do?

He had a vision for a startup that could change the industry, a plan mapped out to perfection in his countless notebooks.
He attended seminars, watched motivational videos, and wrote down strategies late into the night. But he never started.
There was always an excuse—the market wasn’t right, the timing was off, the risks were too high.
Years passed. Life happened. The notebooks gathered dust in a forgotten drawer.
One afternoon, while cleaning his old apartment, Reyansh found those notebooks. He flipped through the pages, nostalgia washing over him. And then, his heart sank.
Every idea he once had was now someone else’s successful business. The world had moved forward. But he hadn’t.
He let out a bitter chuckle and shut the notebook. Maybe he had never been waiting for the right moment.
Maybe the only thing stopping him… was himself.
And he wondered—how many dreams die, not because they weren’t possible, but because we never dared to start?

One evening, while clearing out old books, she found a childhood journal. Curious, she flipped through it and paused at a page she had written years ago: “One day, I will travel the world.”
She laughed softly, shaking her head. That ‘one day’ never came. Instead, she got promotions, attended meetings, and saved money for things she never truly wanted.
She looked at her packed work bag and then at the dusty suitcase in the corner of her room.
For years, she had followed every rule, every expectation. But she couldn’t help but wonder—what’s the point of reaching the destination if the journey never felt like your own?

Their last conversation had been an argument.
“One day, you’ll regret this,” his father had said before hanging up.
Raghav scoffed at the thought. He was young. He had time. Apologies could wait.
But time didn’t wait.
One evening, his phone rang. It was his mother. Her voice was weak. “Papa’s gone.”
Raghav’s heart pounded. He stared at his phone screen in disbelief. It didn’t feel real.
Shaking, he opened his call logs. His father’s last call was still there—unanswered.
Tears blurred his vision. He had always thought there would be another chance, another moment to set things right. But now, that moment will never come.
And he couldn’t help but ask himself—why do we realize the value of people only when they’re no longer there to hear it?

48,Even the softest whispers can inspire the greatest change.,Interconnection & Environmental Awareness,Drama,The Journey of the Whispering Wind,,ENGLISH,"In a quiet village bordered by a mysterious forest lived a young artist named Lila, whose heart was as open as the sky. Every day, Lila would wander through the forest armed with her sketchbook and an insatiable curiosity for the natural world. One breezy morning, as she meandered along a winding path, a soft, inviting whisper carried by the wind led her deeper into the trees.
There, hidden among ancient oaks and delicate wildflowers, stood a wise old tree. Its massive trunk bore the marks of countless seasons, and its leaves murmured the secrets of the forest. The tree spoke to Lila in gentle tones, sharing timeless wisdom about harmony, resilience, and the importance of every creature—no matter how small. It explained that every whisper of the wind, every ripple in a stream, and every flutter of a bird's wing was an integral part of nature's grand conversation.
Inspired by the tree’s lessons, Lila returned to her village with a newfound purpose. She began teaching her community about the interconnectedness of all things. Through art and storytelling, she illustrated how every act of kindness and every small effort towards caring for the earth built a legacy of compassion and unity. Her stories resonated with her neighbors, who soon learned to listen to the subtle voices of nature in their daily lives.
As seasons passed, the village transformed into a community enriched by empathy and respect for every living being. Lila’s journey reminded everyone that even the gentlest whisper can spark a movement of change, and that every voice truly matters.
Moral: True growth blossoms when we listen to all the voices around us and nurture every part of our world.

It wasn’t fancy, but it was cheap and had a bed. The receptionist, an old man with tired eyes, handed him a key and said,
“Room 306. Just one thing—if you see another door at the end of the hall… don’t open it.”
Aakash laughed. “Why? Ghosts?”
The old man didn’t laugh. He just looked at him, expressionless.
Shrugging, Aakash took his key and went upstairs. The hallway was long, dimly lit, and smelled like dust. His room was exactly where the receptionist said. But at the far end of the hall, there was another door. Room 307.
Strange. The guesthouse map at reception hadn’t mentioned a Room 307.
That night, Aakash fell asleep quickly. But at 2:45 AM, loud knocking woke him up.
Knock. Knock. Knock.
It wasn’t at his door. It was coming from 307.
He sat up in bed, heart pounding. The knocking continued—slow, deliberate. He hesitated, then stepped toward the door and peered into the hallway.
307’s door was shaking slightly. Someone—or something—was inside.
He wanted to ignore it. He really did.
But then, something inside the room whispered his name.
“Aakash...”
The knocking stopped. The hallway was silent.
Then he heard a faint click behind him.
His room door. It had just unlocked itself.

At 3:14 AM, one of the screens glitched. Just static.
When the screen came back, a man in a suit was standing in the corridor.
Rishi leaned forward. The mall was empty—who was that? The man stood still, his face slightly blurred, staring directly into the camera.
Confused, Rishi checked another monitor showing the same hallway.
The man wasn’t there.
He switched cameras back and forth. On some screens, the man stood still, looking at the camera. On others, the hallway was completely empty.
His radio crackled. The janitor, who was on the first floor, whispered, ""Rishi, who is that?""
""You see him too?"" Rishi asked, his voice shaking.
Before the janitor could respond, all 16 CCTV monitors went black.
Then, one by one, they flickered back on.
And now, the man in the suit wasn’t in the hallway anymore.
He was standing in the security room.
Right behind Rishi.

There were dozens of messages.
""Stay awake.""
""They come when you sleep.""
""You never listen. You always wake up different.""

Her phone vibrated again. A new message.
""I know you think it’s a joke. Check under your bed.""
Her breath hitched. She sat frozen, her eyes locked on the text.
The room was silent. Too silent.
Slowly, she reached for her phone’s flashlight. With trembling fingers, she bent down and shined the light under her bed.
At first, she saw nothing. Just dust and old shoes.
Then, a hand reached out.
A hand that looked exactly like hers.

Tanya gasped and jerked back, scrambling to her feet.
Her phone vibrated again. Another message.

It was her voice.
Her hands shook as she typed frantically.
""Who are you??""
A response came instantly.
""I told you. I’m you. But I wasn’t fast enough last time.""
Tanya’s breathing became ragged. Last time?
The thing under the bed shifted. She could see a face now—her own.
But its eyes… they were too wide, too dark. It smiled.
""You’re almost out of time.""
Her phone screen dimmed. The clock changed. 12:35 AM.
Then, the lights in her room flickered and went out.

Darkness swallowed the room. The only light was from her phone screen.
A final message appeared.
""Don’t scream. That’s how it gets in.""
Tanya clamped her hand over her mouth. Her body trembled.

But there was one thing that made her uneasy.
The old woman in Flat 401.
Every time Sana left for work, she saw her through the peephole—standing motionless in the hallway, her milky-white eyes staring directly at her door.
She never spoke. Never blinked.
She just… watched.
At first, Sana ignored it. Maybe the woman had dementia? Maybe she was just lonely. But as the days passed, it became unbearable.
Every time she opened her door, the woman was there.
Standing. Watching. Waiting.
One night, a power outage plunged the building into darkness. The dim glow of emergency lights barely lit the hallway.
Sana had had enough.
She marched toward Flat 401 and banged on the door.
“Ma’am? Do you need help?” No answer.
She knocked again. Harder. Still nothing.
A strange, sick feeling curled in her stomach.
She reached for the doorknob.
It turned.
The door creaked open.
The air inside was stale. Thick with dust and the faint stench of something rotting.
She stepped in cautiously, her heart hammering.
The furniture was old and covered in sheets. The wallpaper peeled, exposing the damp, crumbling walls. It looked abandoned.
Like no one had lived there for years.
Then she saw the photographs.
Hundreds of them.
Pinned to the walls. Stacked on tables. Scattered across the floor.
Every single one…
Was of her.
Some were from work. Some from her morning jogs. Some from inside her apartment.

Sana’s breath hitched.
Her skin crawled as her eyes darted around the room.
Then—
She heard it.
A slow, ragged breathing.
Coming from the corner of the room.
The darkness was thick, but she could just make out a figure. Small. Hunched.
Then, with a sickening crack of bones—
It moved.
The woman crawled out of the shadows, her face twisting into something inhuman.
Her mouth stretched too wide.
Her eyes—completely black.
She smiled.
Then, in a voice that wasn’t entirely human, she whispered—
""You finally came home.""
The door behind Sana slammed shut. The Next Morning.
The landlord frowned as he checked his list.
Flat 401? That apartment had been empty for over a decade.

“Must be hearing things again,” he muttered, locking the door.
From inside the apartment, through the dust and shadows, a single photograph lay on the floor.
It was a new one.
A picture of Sana.

And it was here that he had asked her to marry him, just days before he left for war.

Over the next few days, strangers waved at him. Shopkeepers greeted him by name. A woman at the park hugged him and whispered, ""I missed you.""
But he didn’t know any of them.
One night, he found an old newspaper in his apartment. The headline read:
""Man Found Dead in Apartment Fire – Identity Unknown.""
Below, was a photo of him.
His hands shook as he touched his own face. Then, a knock at the door made his blood run cold.
A voice whispered from the other side:
""Aarav, you were never supposed to leave.""

62,,Fantasy,Drama,The Library of Unwritten Stories,,ENGLISH,"Deep in the city stood a hidden library that didn’t lend books. Instead, it stored unfinished stories—ones that were never told, never written, never completed.
One evening, Ananya, a struggling writer, stumbled upon it. The librarian, an old man with silver eyes, greeted her.
""Would you like to see your story?"" he asked.
Confused, she followed him.
There, among thousands of dusty manuscripts, was a book with her name. The Last Story of Ananya Mehta.
She opened it—and her heart stopped.
The words detailed her entire life… but the last page was empty.
""Why isn’t it finished?"" she asked.
The old man smiled sadly. ""Because you stopped writing your own story. You lost hope.""
Tears fell as she realized he was right.
That night, for the first time in years, she picked up her pen. And as she wrote, the pages in the library began to fill.

""Need a ride?"" the driver asked.
Rehan hesitated but got in. The passengers were oddly silent. The lights flickered. Outside, the city seemed… wrong.
It looked older, like he had stepped into the past.
""Where is this bus going?"" he asked.
The driver smiled. ""Home.""
Rehan didn’t understand until he saw a reflection in the window—his younger self, sitting in the back.
Memories flooded back. This was the same bus he had died in, years ago.
As the bus approached the final stop, the driver turned to him.
""This time, you get to choose. Stay… or get off and live.""
Rehan took a deep breath—and stepped off.
The next morning, he woke up in his bed, gasping for air. The accident had never happened.
The bus, the driver, the choice… had saved him.

She wasn’t dead. At least… she didn’t think she was. Yet, there they were—her parents, her friends, everyone sobbing. A framed photo of her was placed in front of the casket.
But then she saw him.
A man in a black coat, standing in the far corner, away from everyone. He wasn’t crying. He wasn’t praying. He just… watched.
Who was he?
She stepped closer, but before she could reach him, he turned and disappeared into the fog.
Later that night, she checked her phone—which had stopped working the day before her ""death."" A new message flashed on the screen.

She looked around. Everyone was scribbling away, lost in their answers.
Her best friend, Meera, who sat beside her, noticed her panic and quickly slid a tiny folded paper under the desk. ""Just in case,"" she whispered.
Sakshi felt her heartbeat hammering.
One glance.
That’s all it would take.
She slowly reached for it, her fingers trembling. But before she could unfold it, a commotion broke out at the front of the class.
Another student had been caught cheating. The teacher’s face was filled with disappointment, not anger. The shame in the boy’s eyes made Sakshi freeze.
She glanced at the chit again.
And then, slowly, she let it fall to the floor and stepped on it.
She finished the exam the best she could—on her own.
When the results came, she had failed the test.
But she had passed in character.
And from that day on, she never relied on shortcuts. She studied harder, with pride, not fear.
And eventually, she became the top student—not just in academics, but in honesty.

But as days passed, work piled up, deadlines became tighter, and the calls from his boss got more frequent.
One morning, as he grabbed his laptop bag, his grandfather held up a cup. ""Just five minutes,"" he said.
Rohan smiled but shook his head. ""I’ll drink later, Dadaji!""
That evening, when he returned, the house felt eerily quiet.
His grandfather’s chair was empty. His cup sat untouched on the table.
A note lay beside it. ""Told you, one day you’d be too busy.""
Rohan felt a lump in his throat. He never got to drink tea with him again.
But from that day on, he always made time for family.
Because some moments don’t wait for ‘later.’

A hooded figure entered the last compartment. No luggage. No ticket. Just silence.

She wore a black hoodie, her face hidden.
""Madam, last stop. You have to leave."" Kabir announced over the speaker.
She didn’t move.
He walked up to her. ""Madam, are you okay?""
Still no response.
His skin crawled. Maybe she was unwell? He gently tapped her shoulder.
She slowly turned her face towards him.
And his heart stopped.

She and Ishaan had been best friends for years. Lately, though, things felt… off. The texts were drier, the calls were shorter, the laughter wasn’t the same.
""Did I do something wrong?""
 ""Is he just busy?""
 ""Or am I just imagining things?""

At work, he was the funny, confident guy.
 With friends, he was the easygoing one.
 At home, he was the obedient son.
But inside? Chaos.
His mind never stopped racing—overthinking every conversation, every decision. Did I say something stupid? What if they secretly hate me?
He wanted to fit in, so he agreed to things he hated—parties, drinking, fake laughter. It was easier than being the odd one out.
His anger issues made things worse. Small things set him off—a delayed text, a joke at his expense, his father comparing him to his ""successful"" cousin.
One night, during dinner, his dad casually said, ""Real men don’t get stressed. Toughen up, Rohan.""
That was it. He snapped.

Her dad looked at her for a long time and said softly, “Exactly. It’s your life. But you don’t see the things I do.”
Aanya didn’t reply. But that night, she found an old box of letters in her dad’s cupboard.

89,,Emotional Struggles & Mental Health,Drama,The Goodbye Message,,ENGLISH,"Rishi was always there for everyone.
The ""nice guy."" The ""good friend."" The one who got texts like:
""You're such a great listener!""
 ""I wish I could find a guy like you!""
 ""Bro, you're overthinking. Just chill!""
But inside? He felt invisible.
His friends found love. His crushes saw him as a therapist, not a partner. His dad? Barely spoke to him unless it was about grades or career.
And when he told people he felt lonely, lost, and exhausted?
""Men don’t get depressed.""
 ""Just focus on work.""
 ""You'll find someone eventually.""
So, he smiled. Laughed at every joke. Replied to every text. Never let anyone see how tired he was.
Until one night.
He turned off his phone. Deleted his socials.
And typed one last message to his best friend, Neha:
""Hey, I'm done. Take care.""
Then he switched off his phone.
Two hours later, there was banging on his door.
Neha, out of breath, eyes filled with tears.
""YOU IDIOT!"" she screamed. ""You thought I’d just ignore that message?!""
Rishi stood frozen. No one had ever chased after him.
For the first time, someone didn’t just say “it’ll be okay.”
She showed up.
That night, he didn’t talk much. He just cried.
And for once, someone listened.

Moral: Strong people break too. And sometimes, all it takes is one person who truly sees you to pull you back. 💙

90,,Emotional Vulnerability & Friendship,Drama,Men Don’t Cry – But He Did,,ENGLISH,"Aarav grew up hearing the same words over and over:
""Be strong.""
 ""Men don’t cry.""
 ""Depression is just in your head.""
So, he didn’t cry.
Not when his mother passed.
 Not when his girlfriend left him, saying, “You never open up.”
 Not even when his father looked at him and said, “You’ll be fine. Just stop overthinking.”
So, he stopped thinking.
He functioned. Ate. Slept (barely). Smiled (faked). Worked.
 But at night, the silence was too loud.
One night, the weight in his chest was unbearable.
He sat in the dark, staring at the bottle of pills on his desk.
""If I disappear, will anyone even notice?""
Aarav picked up his phone. Typed a message to his best friend, Rishi:
""I can’t do this anymore.""
Thumb hovering over SEND.
Then, his screen lit up.
INCOMING CALL: RISHI
He hesitated. Picked up.
""Don’t say a word,"" Rishi’s voice cracked. ""Just listen.""
Aarav sat frozen.
""You think you’re alone?"" Rishi continued. ""I notice every time your smile doesn’t reach your eyes. Every time you say ‘I’m fine’ but your voice is off. Every time you type and delete a message.""
Aarav’s breath hitched. He knew?
""Bro, I don’t care if you think men shouldn’t cry,"" Rishi said. ""I’d rather see you cry than—than not see you at all.""
Silence.
Then, for the first time in years… Aarav broke.
He sobbed.
Not just a tear—ugly, shaking, unstoppable crying.
And Rishi? He stayed on the line the whole night.
Aarav never sent that message.
But Rishi still saved his life.

Moral: You don’t have to scream for help. Sometimes, the right people will hear even your silence. 💙

 He wasn’t rude.
Yet, somehow, he was always the single friend.
At first, it was fine. He laughed at the teasing. “You’ll find someone, bro!”
 But as years passed, one by one, his friends entered relationships.
Couples trips? He wasn’t invited.
 Late-night calls? They were too busy.
 Weekend plans? Third-wheeling wasn’t fun anymore.
Every Instagram scroll was a punch in the gut. More anniversaries. More proposals. More ""perfect love stories.""
And him? Just watching.
""What if I’m meant to be alone?""
 ""What if no one ever chooses me?""
The thought became louder, heavier.
One night, he stared at his reflection. What’s wrong with me?
Then, his phone vibrated. Text from an unknown number.
""Hey, long time! Guess who’s getting married?""
Rohan blinked. Aisha? His first crush. The girl he had once dreamed of a future with.
Something snapped inside him.
He texted back: ""Congrats! Super happy for you!""
But his hands were shaking. Because the truth?
He wasn’t happy. He felt left behind.
The next morning, while scrolling, he saw something strange—a ""5-year ago today"" memory.
A post he had written and forgotten:
""I’d rather wait for the right person than rush into the wrong arms just to feel less alone.""
Rohan exhaled. That was his own advice.
And maybe, just maybe… he wasn’t falling behind. He was just on a different timeline.

Normal was fine.
 Normal was peaceful.
 Normal was when life made sense.
But then… something would happen.
A small mistake. A sarcastic remark. A delay in traffic.
And suddenly—everything turned red.
His hands would tremble. His jaw would clench. His chest would tighten.
And then?
He’d explode.
Words sharper than knives. Fists clenched so tight they left marks. Doors slammed so hard they shook the walls.
But when the red faded?
Regret. Every single time.
""I didn’t mean it.""
 ""I wasn’t thinking.""
 ""It just happened so fast.""
One evening, after another angry outburst at home, his little sister Mira quietly left the dinner table.
Kabir sighed, thinking she was upset.
But later that night, he found her sitting in the corner of her room, hugging her knees.
She flinched when he walked in. Flinched.
Like she was scared of him.
Him.
That hit harder than any punch he had ever thrown.
He swallowed hard. ""Mira… why are you sitting here?""
She hesitated, then whispered, ""Because when you get angry… you become someone else.""
His heart stopped.
He wanted to tell her she was wrong. That he’d never hurt her. That he was just… frustrated.
But the truth?
She wasn’t wrong.
That night, he sat in front of the same mirror he had once shattered.
This time, he didn’t see rage. He saw fear.
Not his own—but the fear he had put into others.
And for the first time, he whispered, ""This has to stop.""
Not for himself. For them.
For the people he loved.
And that was the moment—the exact second—he realized anger wasn’t strength. It was weakness.
And he wasn’t going to be weak anymore.
Moral: True strength isn’t in how loud you shout, but in how much control you have over yourself. 🔥💙

They just... never talked.
Their conversations were dry, mechanical.
""Did you eat?""
 ""Yes.""
 ""How’s college?""
 ""Fine.""
No warmth. No depth. Just two people coexisting under one roof.
His father wasn’t cruel. He wasn’t distant in the way bad fathers are.
He was just… quiet.
Aarav grew up filling the silence with music, books, and friends.
His father filled it with news channels and coffee.
And so, years passed—a father who didn’t know how to express love, and a son who stopped expecting it.
One day, Aarav’s laptop crashed right before a major project submission. Frustrated, he sighed loudly, ruffling his hair.
His father, who had been reading the newspaper, glanced up.
""What happened?""
""Nothing, my laptop’s dead,"" Aarav muttered.
His father said nothing.
The next morning, Aarav woke up to find his laptop fixed.
His father, still sipping his coffee, didn’t even mention it.
It hit Aarav then—his father never used words to show love.
He showed it in actions.
The way he always refilled the petrol in Aarav’s bike.
 The way he waited up when Aarav came home late, pretending he was ""just watching TV.""
 The way he’d silently place Aarav’s favorite snacks in the kitchen.
Later that evening, instead of going straight to his room, Aarav sat beside his father on the couch.
No words. Just two people watching the news together.
And when his father casually slid a cup of chai toward him, Aarav smiled.

But within a week, reality hit.
Maggie for breakfast.
 Oily canteen food for lunch.
 A cold sandwich for dinner.
One night, while scrolling Instagram, he saw his mom’s post:
📸 ""Today’s dinner! Made Rishi’s favorite—aloo paratha with extra butter!"" 😋💛
His stomach grumbled. His throat tightened.

Not the food itself, but what it meant.

 The way his dad would pass him the softest roti from the stack.
 The way they’d all sit together, teasing and laughing.
That night, he cooked for the first time. Not because he was hungry. But because he missed home.
The paratha was burnt. The dal was too salty.
But when he took a bite…
It tasted like home.

“I’ll give one extra credit point to the student who can tell me the hidden word I’ve written on this paper by the end of the class.”

One evening, after yet another day of being mocked for crying when she failed a test, she stormed out of class and found a boy curled up in the corner of the schoolyard, his shoulders shaking.

It was Kabir—the boy known for his confidence, always surrounded by laughter. But now, he was crying.

Aisha hesitated for a moment before sitting beside him. ""You?"" she asked softly. ""Why are you crying?""

Kabir wiped his face quickly. ""I—I'm not crying,"" he muttered. But his red eyes betrayed him.

She smiled. ""You know, everyone calls me weak because I cry a lot.""

Kabir stayed silent.

""But I think crying is a strength,"" she continued. ""The people who can't cry properly, can't laugh properly either. If you hold back pain, you also hold back happiness.""

Kabir let out a small chuckle, surprising himself. ""That... actually makes sense.""

Then, with a deep breath, he confessed, ""My parents are getting divorced. I act cool in front of everyone, but... it hurts. A lot.""

Aisha nodded. ""And it's okay to feel that. To let it out. No one should tell you otherwise.""

Just then, a loud voice interrupted them. ""Hey, Kabir! What's wrong? Crying like a baby?"" A group of boys stood a few feet away, smirking.

Kabir froze. But before he could say anything, Aisha stood up, her eyes blazing. ""If you think crying makes someone weak, then maybe you've never had the courage to face your own feelings.""

The boys looked taken aback. Kabir, inspired by her words, wiped his tears and stood up beside her. ""Yeah. Maybe you should try it sometime.""

The group shuffled awkwardly before walking away, speechless.

She grinned. ""Tears don’t make us weak. They make us human.""

One evening, her friend Riya needed help with a project. Ankita stayed up all night, skipping her own work, just to make it perfect. The next day, when Riya’s project won, she barely acknowledged Ankita’s effort. Instead, someone whispered that Ankita had done it for attention. The same friends she sacrificed for began to turn against her.

It wasn’t the first time. Every time Ankita tried to do the right thing, it backfired. She started making choices not for herself but out of fear—agreeing to things she hated, laughing when she wanted to cry. Her reflection in the mirror became a stranger, caged by her own need to be accepted.

One day, she overheard a conversation. “Ankita always tries too hard. It’s suffocating.”

Something clicked. She wasn’t losing friends because she was doing things wrong; she was losing herself trying to keep them.

That day, she made a choice. She stopped over-explaining, stopped proving herself, stopped doing things just to please. Some friends drifted away, but the ones who remained were real.

 The fear of losing people shouldn’t make you lose yourself. True friends will stay for who you are, not for what you do for them.

A chilling silence followed. Then, suddenly, the shadows lunged toward her, their faces twisting into something monstrous. She stumbled back, her foot slipping on the edge of the bridge. Just as she was about to fall, an unseen force pulled her back to safety.

Breathing heavily, she looked up to see a young girl, about her age, standing before her. ""Who are you?"" Anaya whispered.

Their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Sharma, believed in giving them everything—expensive gadgets, the best education, and even solving their smallest problems. If they forgot their lunch, their mother rushed to school. If they had an argument with friends, their father intervened. Every decision, from what clothes to wear to which career path to follow, was made for them.

Years passed, and Aarav and Riya grew up, excelling in academics but struggling with basic responsibilities. When Aarav got his first job, he called his mother to ask how to book a train ticket. Riya, despite being brilliant in college, couldn’t cook a simple meal or handle bills without her father’s guidance.

They felt lost, helpless, and overwhelmed. It was then they realized how much they had relied on their parents for every little thing.
The Twist
While managing hospital paperwork, Aarav and Riya accidentally misplaced an important document. Panicked, they called their mother, only to hear her say, ""I trust you both will figure it out.""

Her paintings reflected her soul—raw, unfiltered. Some days, her art radiated warmth, a celebration of joy. Other days, it was a tempest, an eruption of sorrow and rage. People admired her talent, but few stayed close. She was unpredictable—one moment laughing, the next pushing people away.
Karan was the only one who had endured it all. He had seen her light and darkness, her passion and pain. But even he had limits.
One evening, as Riya furiously slashed black and grey onto a canvas, Karan sighed. “Riya, you push people away when you’re hurting. But emotions aren’t walls—they’re colors. You just need to learn how to blend them.”
His words struck something deep inside her. That night, she stood in front of her mirror, paint-streaked hands trembling. Maybe it wasn’t the world that didn’t understand her. Maybe she had never tried to understand herself.
The next day, she signed up for therapy. She practiced mindfulness, learned to pause before reacting, and found other ways to express herself—journaling, long walks, deep breaths. She still painted, but now, her emotions weren’t wild storms—they were carefully woven stories.
A year later, she stood in an art gallery, surrounded by canvases that told her journey. The exhibition was called The Colors of Me. People didn’t just see her paintings—they felt them. Strangers wiped away tears, friends hugged her tightly, and Karan stood beside her, proud.
In that moment, Riya realized something: vulnerability wasn’t weakness. When shared in a healthy way, it built bridges instead of walls.
Emotions are like colors. When balanced, they don’t just create art—they create connection.

109,,"Friendship, Nostalgia, Emotional Growth",Drama,The Unseen Thread,,ENGLISH,"Aryan, Kabir, and Rohan had been inseparable since childhood. Whether it was school projects, weekend adventures, or late-night conversations, they were always together. Their friendship was effortless, like the flow of a river—strong, unbreakable.
But as they grew older, life started pulling them in different directions. Aryan became busy with his music, Kabir with his startup dreams, and Rohan found himself immersed in photography. They never fought, yet something was off. Texts were left unanswered, plans postponed, and slowly, secrets crept into their bond. They tried to keep things as they were—movie nights, road trips—but the warmth felt forced.
One day, Rohan planned a surprise meetup at their childhood hangout, a rooftop where they used to dream about their future. When they arrived, he handed them an old envelope. Inside were letters they had written to each other years ago, promising that no matter where life took them, their bond would remain.
Silence filled the air. That’s when Kabir finally spoke, “We never wanted this distance, did we?”
Aryan sighed, “We just assumed the other was too busy… so we stopped trying.”
That’s when it hit them—their friendship hadn’t died, it had just been waiting to be revived.
Sometimes, bonds don’t break; they just get buried under unspoken words. True friendship isn’t about never changing, but about making the effort to reconnect, no matter how much time has passed.
"
110,,"Inspirational, Family Dynamics",Drama,The Rebel’s Revelation,,ENGLISH,"Aarya had always been a rebel. If her parents said white, she chose black. If they warned her against something, she ran toward it. Rules were just invisible chains, and she refused to be bound.
One day, her father, a renowned businessman, told her, “Never invest in emotions over logic. Feelings cloud judgment.”
So, naturally, Aarya did the opposite. She took her entire savings and invested in a failing local bookstore, run by an old man named Mr. Kapoor. The shop had been in her neighborhood for decades, but it was struggling against online retailers. Everyone, including her father, called it a terrible decision.
But Aarya saw something no one else did. She used her creativity and tech-savviness to transform the bookstore into a community hub—hosting storytelling nights, study groups, and even an online platform for rare books. Within months, the store not only survived but flourished.
One evening, her father walked into the buzzing shop, eyes wide with surprise. “I told you emotions don’t make good investments,” he said.
Aarya smiled. “Maybe. But sometimes, emotions are what turn a failing business into a legacy.”
Her father chuckled, finally understanding her perspective.
Logic builds success, but passion sustains it. Sometimes, rebellion isn’t about defying others—it’s about proving that there’s more than one way to win.

111,,"Romance, Regret",Drama,"The Unfinished Letter
",,ENGLISH,"Aaron had always kept his relationships short—never more than a few months. The idea of commitment made his chest tighten, as if love was a contract with an inevitable heartbreak clause. But then came Mia—warm, patient, and understanding. She never pressured him, never demanded more than he could give. And that scared him the most.
One evening, as they watched the city lights from his balcony, Mia turned to him. ""What are you so afraid of, Aaron?""
He hesitated, gripping the railing. ""Losing you.""
She smiled, but there was sadness in her eyes. ""Then why are you leaving me before that even happens?""
That night, Aaron wrote a letter—a confession of his fears, his love, and his wish to be with her. But he couldn’t bring himself to send it. He left it unfinished, tucked inside a book on his shelf.
Years passed. Regret became a quiet echo in his heart. One day, he heard that Mia had moved on, married, and found happiness.
One evening, while cleaning, Aaron found the old letter. As he unfolded it, a smaller note slipped out—one he didn’t remember writing.
It was in Mia’s handwriting.
""I found this the night I left. I wished you had finished it. But I hope, someday, you'll finish a love story—with someone who won’t have to read your words in secret.""
Aaron felt the weight of what he had lost—not because love had failed him, but because he had failed to fight for it.
Fear of losing someone shouldn’t stop you from loving them. Sometimes, the risk of heartbreak is the price of a love worth having.
"
112,,"Self Acceptance, Empowerment",Drama,Reflections of Love,,ENGLISH,"Aarohi had always been the target of cruel comments about her skin. Every day, people pointed out her acne, her scars, and the imperfections she already struggled to accept. ""You should try this cream,"" they’d say, or ""Why don’t you do something about your face?"" Their words clung to her like shadows, making her feel small.
One evening, after another hurtful encounter, she rushed home, tears spilling down her cheeks. She locked herself in her room, staring at her reflection in the mirror, hating what she saw. ""Why me?"" she whispered.
Just then, she noticed something strange—the mirror flickered. She stepped closer, wiping her tears, and gasped. The reflection in the mirror… it wasn't crying. It was smiling.
Aarohi stepped back in shock. The reflection—her reflection—spoke.
 ""Do you think love comes from perfect skin? Do you think happiness comes from others' approval?""
She shook her head in disbelief. ""Who… who are you?"" she stammered.
""I’m you. The version of you that already knows her worth. The version that doesn’t need flawless skin to feel beautiful.""
Tears welled in her eyes again, but this time, they weren’t of pain. She watched as the reflection touched its own scars with pride. Aarohi hesitantly did the same, feeling the warmth of her own skin.
""Love yourself first, Aarohi. The world will follow.""
And for the first time, she believed it.

113,,"Self Realization, Addiction",Drama,Smoke and Mirrors,,ENGLISH,"Aarav sat on the dimly lit balcony, watching the city breathe beneath him. His fingers trembled as he pulled a cigarette from the pack. Work pressure, failed relationships, expectations—it all piled up, suffocating him. The first drag gave a fleeting illusion of control, a temporary escape from reality.
Tonight was different, though. As he exhaled, the smoke curled into shapes—faces, words—almost as if whispering secrets.
""Stress isn’t the problem, is it?"" a voice murmured.
Startled, Aarav turned. An older version of himself sat across from him, mirroring his every move. Wrinkles lined his face, his eyes dull.
 ""You think this is an escape?"" the older Aarav chuckled, flicking his own cigarette into the air. ""It’s a chain.""
Aarav’s chest tightened. ""Who are you?""
""I'm who you become if you don’t stop."" The older Aarav exhaled a cloud of smoke that formed into shackles around his wrists.
 ""Every puff is a promise—one that steals your time, your health, your dreams.""
The wind howled, and just like that, the vision disappeared. Aarav looked down at the cigarette in his hand, then at the city once more. Was this how he wanted his future to look?
With a deep breath, he crushed the cigarette under his heel and pulled out his phone. Instead of ordering another pack, he called his best friend.
""Hey… I need help quitting. Can we meet?""
That night, he made a new escape—one toward a healthier future.

114,,"Family, Academic Pressure",Drama,The Final Call,,ENGLISH,"Rohan had always been an average student, but his parents expected excellence. Living miles away from home in a big city, he struggled to balance studies, chores, and the loneliness that came with it.
When his semester results arrived, he saw the dreaded numbers—barely passing. His phone buzzed. It was his father.
""If you can’t score well, we’ll bring you back home. No more college, no more dreams!""
Rohan felt his world collapsing. The pressure was suffocating, but he clenched his fists. No. I won’t let fear control me.
Determined, he changed his approach. He sought help from professors, joined study groups, and managed his time better. Months passed, and exams returned.
On results day, he hesitated before opening the portal. His heart pounded. Then—his eyes widened. He had topped his class!
Just as he picked up the phone to call home, his father called first.
""Rohan, we’re proud of you! But son… we’ve realized something. We should have supported you, not scared you. Success comes from learning, not fear. We’re sorry.""
Rohan smiled. The real victory wasn’t just in marks—it was in changing mindsets.
True growth happens when support replaces fear. Pressure breaks, but guidance builds.
"
115,,"Friendship, Betrayal",Drama,The Weight of Guilt,,ENGLISH,"Rohan and Karan had been inseparable since childhood. They did everything together—played cricket in the colony park, studied late into the night, and dreamed about their futures. But lately, Rohan felt an unfamiliar heaviness whenever he was around Karan, as if he were constantly doing something wrong.
“You never think before you speak, Rohan. That’s why people don’t take you seriously,” Karan would remark, patting his back like it was advice. Or, “We lost today because you weren’t focused enough. You should have practiced more.” Rohan initially brushed it off, believing Karan had good intentions. But the comments never stopped, and doubt began creeping into his mind.
The final straw came during their college’s debate competition. Rohan had spent weeks preparing, refining his arguments, and perfecting his delivery. Yet, Karan’s words echoed in his head. What if I mess up? What if I embarrass our team? Just before they took the stage, Karan leaned in and muttered, “Don’t overthink it... though you always do. Just don’t ruin it for us.”
Something inside Rohan snapped. He clenched his fists but forced a smile and walked onto the stage. As he gripped the mic, his doubts faded. He spoke with confidence, countered every argument, and, for the first time in a long while, felt proud of himself. When the judges announced their victory, Karan’s expression was unreadable.
Later that evening, Rohan went backstage to collect his belongings and overheard Karan talking to a member of the opposing team. “Honestly, I was hoping Rohan would get nervous and back out. I had a backup speech ready. Guess he got lucky this time.”
A chill ran through Rohan. All this time, Karan had been planting seeds of doubt—not to help him, but to hold him back. Taking a deep breath, Rohan walked up to him and, for the first time, met his gaze with quiet certainty.
“You know,” he said, his voice steady, “I finally realized something. The guilt you made me feel—it was never mine to carry.”
And with that, he walked away, feeling lighter than he had in years.
Sometimes, the people who make you feel the smallest do it because they’re afraid of how big you can become. Don’t let anyone make you doubt your worth.

116,,"Academic struggle, justice",Drama,The Last Question,,ENGLISH,"Aarav had always been a bright student, the kind who asked questions that made teachers pause. But in Professor Malhotra’s class, questions were unwelcome. The professor had favorites—students who nodded, agreed, and never challenged.
Despite Aarav’s efforts, his grades never reflected his hard work. His classmates whispered about it. “Malhotra’s favorites always get the top scores,” they said. Aarav tried harder, but the more he spoke up, the more he was dismissed.
Then came the final exam—graded subjectively. As expected, Aarav’s score was lower than students who barely wrote a page. That night, he sat alone, questioning everything. Was I not good enough? Was the system even fair?
Determined, he took his answer sheet to the principal. “Just re-evaluate it,” he pleaded. The principal sighed but agreed.
Days later, an announcement shook the school. Professor Malhotra was dismissed. It turned out Aarav wasn’t the only victim—years of favoritism had been swept under the rug. And Aarav’s score? It was one of the highest in the class.
As he walked out of the office, Aarav glanced at the school walls, the very ones that had once made him feel small. Today, they felt different. Because he had asked one last question—the one that changed everything.
 Never stop questioning injustice. Sometimes, the system isn’t broken—it just needs someone brave enough to expose the cracks.
"
117,,"Friendship, Masculinity and Vulnerability",Drama,The Mask of Strength,,ENGLISH,"Aarav had always been the strong one—the one his friends relied on, the one who never faltered. He had learned that real men don’t cry, that emotions were weaknesses, and that his struggles were his alone to bear.
But inside, he was drowning. The weight of expectations, failures, and unspoken fears pressed against his chest like a storm he couldn’t escape. His nights were sleepless, his smiles forced. Still, he showed up every day, laughing, working, pretending.
One evening, after a long day at work, Aarav sat in his car, gripping the steering wheel as the walls around him finally cracked. A single tear slipped down his cheek.
A tap on the window startled him. It was Rohan, his closest friend. Aarav quickly wiped his face and rolled down the window.
“Hey, what’s up?” he asked, forcing a grin.
Rohan hesitated, then sighed. “You tell me.”
Aarav chuckled. “I’m fine, bro. Just tired.”
Rohan studied him for a moment before saying, “I saw you, Aarav. And it’s okay.”
Something in his tone—understanding, not pity—made Aarav’s defenses waver.
Then, Rohan did something unexpected. He sat beside Aarav, looked straight ahead, and after a deep breath, whispered, “I’ve been there too.”
Aarav turned, surprised. Rohan—the guy who always seemed to have it together—was admitting to the same silent war?
And for the first time in years, Aarav felt something shift. Maybe strength wasn’t in hiding pain. Maybe it was in sharing it.
That night, they talked—really talked. And as Aarav left, he realized he hadn’t just spoken about his struggles; he had taken the first step towards healing.
The world expected him to wear a mask, but true strength, he learned, was in taking it off.
Strength isn’t in suppressing pain but in acknowledging it. You are never as alone as you think.
"
118,,"Slice of life/ Hope, College Life",Drama,The Silent Notebook,,ENGLISH,"Aarav had always dreamt of studying in a prestigious college. When he finally got in, he was excited to start his new life—new friends, new city, new beginnings. But reality hit hard. The hostel food was terrible, his grades were slipping, and friendships weren’t as effortless as he thought. Nights felt lonelier than ever.

One evening, after another tasteless dinner, he sat on his bed staring at his messy desk. Books lay scattered, notes half-written, a reminder of the assignments he had no motivation to finish. Just then, he noticed an old notebook lying at the bottom of the pile. It wasn’t his.

Curious, he opened it. Inside were handwritten entries—stories of struggles, heartbreak, and pressure. The words mirrored his own battles. But as he flipped through, he saw something unexpected: at the end of each page, the writer had penned down a solution, a lesson, a small act of resilience. “When the food is bad, cook something with friends—it tastes better.” “When studies feel impossible, ask for help. You’re never as alone as you think.” “Friendships will break, but new ones will be made—give it time.”

Intrigued, Aarav checked the last page. One final message was scribbled: “If you found this, remember—college is tough, but you’re tougher. Now, pass this on.”

Aarav smiled. He wasn’t alone after all. That night, he wrote his own struggles in the notebook, along with a lesson he had learned. The next day, he left it on another desk in the library—for the next lost student to find.

In the toughest times, we feel alone, but the truth is—everyone is fighting their own battles. Help can come from unexpected places, and sometimes, just knowing someone else understands can make all the difference.
"
119,,Social Drama/ Self-Acceptance,Drama,The Unmasked Truth,,ENGLISH,"Aarav always tried to please everyone. At work, he laughed at jokes he didn’t find funny. At home, he agreed to things he didn’t want. Online, he carefully curated his image.

One day, an old college friend, Riya, messaged him: ""Hey, I saw a post about you. People are saying you've changed... in a bad way.""

Heart racing, he searched his name and found a thread of people debating his character. Some called him fake. Others said he had an attitude. A few defended him.

Aarav panicked. He wanted to explain, to set the record straight. But then, he stopped. What would that change?

For the first time, he did nothing. He closed his laptop, took a deep breath, and went for a walk.

Days passed. The world didn’t end. His real friends still called. His work still mattered. And he, for once, felt lighter.

 A week later, he checked the post again—it was buried under a hundred new debates about someone else.

 People's opinions are temporary, but your peace is permanent—if you choose it.

120,,Emotional Drama/ Healing & Self-Discovery,Drama,The Last Message,,ENGLISH,"Mira sat on her bed, phone in hand, staring at the last message she had sent to Aaron.

""I love you, but I have to love myself more.""

She had pressed send two weeks ago, blocking his number immediately after. It wasn’t rage or bitterness that had made her do it—it was survival.

For years, Aaron had been her best friend. He had a way of making her feel seen, like she was the only person in the room who mattered. But he also had a way of making her doubt herself, chipping away at her confidence with little remarks disguised as jokes. She would shrink so he could shine, apologize for things that weren’t her fault, and ignore the ache in her chest every time he dismissed her feelings.

Still, cutting him off felt like losing a limb. Some nights, she would reach for her phone, typing out messages she’d never send. ""How are you?"" ""I miss you."" ""Did I make the right choice?"" But she knew the answer.

Tonight was one of those nights. But as she hesitated, her phone buzzed. A new email.

Subject: I’m Sorry.

Her heart pounded. It was from Aaron.

She opened it, hands trembling.

""Mira, I know you won’t read this, but I need to say it. You were right to leave. I’ve spent the last two weeks replaying everything, and I see now how much I took you for granted. I made you feel small because I was scared of how brightly you shined. That was never your fault. It was mine. I won’t ask you to come back, but I do want you to know—I'm working on being better. Thank you for waking me up.""

Tears welled in Mira’s eyes. She had expected resentment, anger, or nothing at all. But this?

She exhaled slowly, closed the email, and didn’t reply.

Because sometimes, the apology comes. And sometimes, you still have to walk away.

Healing isn’t about waiting for an apology—it’s about knowing when you no longer need one.

121,,Family Drama,Drama,The Quiet Effort,,ENGLISH,"Rahul sat quietly at the dinner table as his father beamed with pride, praising his sister—her promotion, her kindness, her endless achievements.
“And Rahul?” his father asked, almost as an afterthought, turning to him with mild curiosity.
“I... I’ve been working at the store,” Rahul said softly, stirring the rice on his plate.
His father barely reacted. “Good,” he muttered before turning back to his sister’s stories.
Rahul swallowed the lump in his throat. He was used to this. His efforts always seemed small in comparison. But he never argued, never sought validation. He simply carried on.
Days later, their father fell ill. What started as a mild fever soon turned into fatigue, making it difficult for him to even get out of bed. Medicines, groceries, meals—everything seemed to pile up. His sister, buried in office work, couldn’t be around much.
Without a word, Rahul stepped in. He managed the errands, cooked meals, and stayed up late to check on their father. Each night, he sat by his father’s bedside, making sure he was comfortable. He didn’t expect recognition. He just did what needed to be done.
One evening, as their father sipped tea, he glanced at Rahul, who was cleaning up after dinner.
“You know... I always thought your sister carried this family,” he said quietly. “But now I know... I can lean on you too.”
Rahul paused, his hands trembling slightly as he put the dishes away. He didn’t need a grand acknowledgment. Just this—just being seen—was enough.
Moral: Sometimes, proving your worth isn’t about being seen—it’s about showing up when it matters most.
"
122,,Social Drama/ Personal Growth,Drama,The Shadow and the Light,,ENGLISH,"Rahul’s sister was perfect. Top of her class, admired by everyone, effortlessly making their parents proud. And Rahul? He felt like nothing more than her shadow.
At home, conversations revolved around her. At school, teachers compared him to her. No matter what he did, he was always just ‘her brother.’
Determined to carve his own identity, he took a job at a small café. It wasn’t a prestigious position, but at least it was something that was his.
One evening, chaos erupted in the café. A customer stormed in, yelling at the staff over a misplaced order. The manager froze. The staff panicked. The air was thick with tension.
Rahul didn’t think—he simply acted. He stepped forward, listened patiently, and calmly offered a solution. The man left—still annoyed, but calmer. The crisis was averted, and the staff sighed in relief.
Later that night, Rahul was wiping down tables when he saw his father at the door.
“I heard what you did today,” his father said, watching him closely.
Rahul braced himself for a lecture, but instead, his father smiled.
“Your sister is amazing,” he continued, “but you? You have something else—patience, calmness... strength. I never noticed before, but I see it now.”
For the first time, Rahul didn’t feel like a shadow. He didn’t have to outshine anyone—he had his own light.
Moral: You don’t have to outshine others—you just have to find your own way to shine.

123,,Family Drama,Drama,The Unseen Bridge,,ENGLISH,"Rahul’s sister seemed to have it all together—top grades, a great job, always impressing their parents. Meanwhile, Rahul felt like he was constantly struggling—failing classes, drifting aimlessly, unsure of where he belonged.
Determined to prove himself, he took a small job at a hardware store. It wasn’t much, but it was something.
One evening, Rahul came home to find his sister sitting alone in the dimly lit living room, staring at the floor. Her shoulders were tense, and her hands trembled slightly.
“You okay?” he asked, hesitating.
“I can’t do this alone,” she whispered. “Dad expects too much... and I just... can’t.”
Rahul had never seen her like this. She was always strong, always put together. But now, she looked... exhausted.
That night, Rahul stayed up late, helping her with chores, preparing meals for the week, and quietly taking on responsibilities she never had time for. He didn’t seek credit—he just wanted to help.
Over time, their father noticed—not Rahul’s job, not his grades—but the way he quietly held things together. One evening, as they sat in the living room, his father spoke.
“You’re stronger than you think,” he said. “Not because you’re like your sister… but because you know how to hold things together.”
For the first time, Rahul felt like he belonged—not in comparison to someone else, but as himself.

124,,Romance,Drama,The Locked Door,,ENGLISH,"Aarav once loved deeply—so deeply that his world revolved around her. But fate had other plans. She was gone, leaving nothing but memories that refused to fade.
In the years that followed, Aarav built walls around his heart. No attachments, no warmth—just silence.
One evening, a knock disrupted his solitude. He opened the door to find Anaya, his neighbor’s daughter, holding a broken bicycle chain.
“Could you fix my bike?” she asked, grinning.
Aarav sighed but took the chain, reattaching it without a word. She beamed and thanked him before skipping away.
It didn’t end there. Anaya kept showing up—asking questions, sharing stories, leaving little gifts on his windows . Aarav never said much, but somehow... he didn’t mind.
One winter night, she knocked again. This time, her smile was gone.
“My dad’s in the hospital,” she whispered, her voice shaking.
Aarav didn’t hesitate. He grabbed his coat and went with her, sitting beside her in the cold hospital hallway, offering silent support.
That night, as Anaya rested her head on his shoulder, Aarav felt something stir—not pain, but warmth.
Moral: Sometimes the walls we build to keep out pain end up keeping out love too.

125,,Family Drama,Drama,The Last Slice,,ENGLISH,"Rohan sat at the table, staring at the empty pizza box. His brother, Aryan, had grabbed the last slice—again.
“Seriously?” Rohan muttered. “You always get the best stuff.”
Aryan shrugged. “Guess you’re just too slow.”
Rohan clenched his fists but said nothing.
Later that evening, Aryan’s bike chain broke, and he struggled to fix it. Rohan knew how—but this time, he just stood there, watching.
“Hey!” Aryan called. “A little help?”
Rohan sighed, grabbed his tools, and fixed the chain without a word.
“You didn’t have to,” Aryan mumbled.
“I know,” Rohan said, wiping his hands. “But just because life’s unfair doesn’t mean I have to be.”
Aryan looked at him for a long moment before nodding. That night, when their mother brought out dessert, Aryan silently pushed the last piece toward Rohan.
For the first time, fairness didn’t need words—it was simply understood.
Moral: Unfairness is everywhere—but choosing kindness is what sets you apart.
"
126,,Social Commentary,Drama,The Unsent Message,,ENGLISH,"The phone buzzed, lighting up Arya’s screen. A text from her best friend, Sonya:
“We need to talk.”
Arya’s heart pounded. What did I do? Was it something I said?
She scrolled through their chats — had she been too blunt last week? Maybe she forgot Sonya’s birthday. Or… what if Meera had heard about that awkward moment when Arya tripped in the cafeteria?
Her mind spiraled. She started typing: “Hey, if I upset you, I’m really sorry...” Then she deleted it. “Is everything okay?” Delete.
Hours dragged by. Each minute stretched longer than the last. Finally, Sonya called.
“Hey!” she chirped. “I just needed help picking a gift for mom. Any ideas?”
Arya froze. “That’s... that’s it?”
“Yeah,” Sonya laughed. “Why?”
Arya chuckled weakly, feeling silly. All those imaginary disasters — and none of them had been real.
Moral: Sometimes the worst scenarios live only in our minds.

His face burned. He didn’t mean to yell, but the frustration kept bubbling up — always too fast, always too loud.
Kicking a rock down the road, he froze when he spotted something in the grass — his sister’s bracelet. The one their dad had gifted her years ago.
Ravi’s chest tightened. Just that morning, he’d snapped at her for borrowing his headphones without asking. He’d barely let her explain before walking out.
He rushed home. His sister was curled up on the couch, red-eyed.
“I found this,” he muttered, handing her the bracelet.
She didn’t say anything — just hugged him tightly.
“I knew you’d come back,” she whispered.
Ravi realized then — no matter how strong his anger felt, love had always been stronger.
Moral: Sometimes the ones we lash out at are the ones who believe in us the most.

128,,Romance,Drama,The Empty Chair ,,ENGLISH,"Rohan gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white as he stared through the café window. Inside, Maya sat by the window, stirring her coffee absentmindedly while scrolling through her phone.
He knew why she had asked him to meet—it was time for that conversation. The one where she’d ask where things were going, where they were going.
His heart pounded. What if I say the wrong thing? What if I disappoint her? What if I can’t be the person she needs? The thoughts wrapped around him like chains, heavy and suffocating.
His fingers twitched on the key. I should go in… I should at least try. He almost stepped out. Almost.
But then the fear crept in. I’ll just mess things up. She deserves better.
Minutes passed. Maya kept glancing at the door—first hopeful, then uncertain. Then, finally, disappointed. She sighed, picked up her bag, and walked away.
Rohan watched her leave. His chest ached, but he stayed frozen. And as he stared at the empty chair she left behind, realization sank in.
By avoiding the risk, he had already lost.
Moral: Fear of failing can sometimes make you miss something worth fighting for.

129,,Slice of life/ Hope,Drama,The Silent Guest ,,ENGLISH,"Every evening, Sameer carefully set his dining table for two—one plate for himself, and one for someone who never arrived.
His neighbor once noticed. “Expecting someone?” they asked with a curious smile.
Sameer forced a chuckle. “Just… in case.”
But the truth was heavier. The empty seat wasn’t for someone coming—it was for someone who had left. Over the years, friends had drifted away, too busy, too distant. And loneliness had crept in so gradually that he barely noticed when silence became his only company.
Yet, every evening, he still set that second plate. A quiet hope that one day, someone might fill it.
One night, a knock at the door startled him. His neighbor stood there, holding a warm meal.
“I figured you might like some company,” they said.
For a moment, Sameer hesitated. Then, slowly, he pulled out the second chair.
Moral: Sometimes, hope keeps us waiting… but kindness is what finally ends the wait.

130,,Peer pressure,Drama,The Red Mark,,ENGLISH,"Kunal winced as the rubber band snapped against his wrist, leaving an angry red mark. His friends roared with laughter.
“Your turn now,” one of them grinned, handing him the band.
Kunal hesitated, rubbing his sore skin. It was just a game—snap the band, endure the sting, prove you could take it. That was the rule. That’s how they earned respect.
But as he looked around, he saw the truth hidden beneath the laughter. The way some flinched just before the snap. The forced smiles. The silent discomfort.
Suddenly, the whole thing felt pointless.
“I’m good,” Kunal muttered, dropping the band onto the table.
The group stared. Then, one of the boys hesitated, looking at his own wrist before quietly setting his band down too.
“Yeah,” he said. “I’m good too.”
One by one, the others followed. The game was over—not with a bang, but with a choice.
Moral: Walking away isn’t weakness—sometimes it’s the strongest choice you can make.

131,,Emotional Drama,Drama,The Forgotten Key,,ENGLISH,"Aman patted his pockets. No key.
He sighed and knocked on his friend Adil’s door. “Lost my key,” he explained. “Mind if I crash here tonight?”
Adil hesitated. “Uh… actually… I’m kinda busy.”
Something about his tone felt off, but Aman nodded and turned to leave.
Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw it—his stolen backpack, peeking from behind Adil’s couch. The same backpack that had gone missing days ago.
His chest tightened. Betrayal burned through him, hot and bitter. He could confront Adil. He could demand answers. But as he stood there, something in him shifted.
Without a word, Aman turned and walked away.
The next day, he quietly changed his locks—and his circle of friends.
Moral: Betrayal doesn’t always need a confrontation—sometimes silence speaks loudest.

""They know… They know what you did…”
Her heart pounded. She pressed her ear against the wall, but the sounds faded into silence. Had she imagined it?
The next night, it happened again. The whispers slithered through the dark.
""They know… They know everything…”
Her mind spiraled. Who? What do they know? Did her boss find out she messed up the report? Had her friend overheard her complaining about her? Was someone watching her?
Sleep became impossible. She avoided her apartment at night, lingering in coffee shops and walking aimlessly until exhaustion forced her home.
One evening, her neighbor knocked on her door. “Hey, you’ve been leaving your TV on all night,” he said casually. “Everything okay?”
TV? Nina frowned. She barely even watched it. She grabbed the remote and pressed the power button—it was jammed. The whispers played again.
Static.
She let out a shaky laugh, more out of relief than amusement. It was just white noise, yet her mind had turned it into a storm.
Moral: Fear thrives in silence—don’t let it speak louder than reason.

133,,Emotional Realism,Drama,The Borrowed Book ,,ENGLISH,"Every week, Reema visited the library—not because she loved reading, but because she hated feeling alone.
She’d pick a book, settle into her favorite chair by the window, and pretend to read. She would turn the pages at a careful pace, just slow enough to seem engaged, but fast enough that no one could ask her about the story.
She hoped—just once—that someone might notice her, strike up a conversation, ask what she was reading. But no one ever did. The library was filled with whispers, rustling pages, the occasional quiet laughter from a group of friends. But Reema sat in silence, her only companion the books she never truly read.
One evening, as she was leaving, she realized she had left her book on the table. She hesitated, but the library was closing, and she told herself she’d grab it tomorrow.
When she returned, she found the book exactly where she had left it—except now, something was different. A note was tucked between the pages.
""I loved this book too. Maybe we could talk about it sometime?""
Her heart pounded. Someone had noticed. Someone had reached out.
She clutched the book to her chest, rereading the note over and over. For the first time in a long time, she felt something other than loneliness—she felt seen.

134,,Psychological Drama,Drama,The Burning Wallet,,ENGLISH,"Vikram sat in his friend’s dimly lit room, the air thick with the scent of smoke and sweat. Laughter echoed around him as one of the guys flicked a lighter under a crumpled bill.
“Just a dare,” someone snickered. The flame curled the edges of the note, blackening it before it crumbled into ashes.
Vikram’s turn. A lighter was tossed to him. “Come on, your turn. It’s just paper.”
He stared at it. The fire flickered, waiting. Around him, the pressure tightened. He could already hear the teasing if he refused. Don’t be soft. Don’t be scared.
His fingers hovered over the flame… then, suddenly, he tossed the lighter back onto the table.
“Yeah, I am scared,” he said. “Not of fire—of being stupid.”
A hush fell over the room. A few guys exchanged glances, but one of them—Aman—nodded. “Glad someone’s got sense,” he muttered under his breath.
The lighter remained untouched for the rest of the night.
Moral: Courage isn’t proving you can go along with the crowd—it’s knowing when to walk away.

135,,Friendship,Drama,The Borrowed Jacket,,ENGLISH,"Ishaan and Karan had been best friends for years. That’s why, when Karan asked to borrow Ishaan’s favorite jacket, he didn’t think twice. “I’ll return it soon,” Karan promised with a grin.
Weeks passed. Ishaan didn’t want to seem pushy, so he waited. But the jacket never came back.
Then, one evening, he spotted Karan across the street, laughing with a group of friends. And there it was—his jacket, wrapped snugly around Karan’s shoulders, as if itnever belonged to Ishaan at all.
A strange feeling settled in his chest—not quite anger, not quite sadness. Just… disappointment. He could have confronted Karan, demanded his jacket back. But what would that change? If Karan had cared, he wouldn’t have avoided him.
So Ishaan just walked away.
The next morning, there was a knock at his door. Karan stood there, the jacket folded in his hands. He looked guilty. “I was scared you’d be mad,” he admitted. “So I just… avoided you.”
Ishaan sighed, then gave a small smile. “Next time, just say so.”
Moral: Mistakes can break trust—but honesty can mend it.

136,,Emotional drama,Drama,The Vanishing Smile,,ENGLISH,"Riya had always been known for her bright smile—the one that made people feel warm, the one that lit up every conversation.
But lately, something had changed.
After every interaction, she replayed the words in her head. Did I sound rude? What if they didn’t actually like talking to me? What if I embarrassed myself?
She started overanalyzing everything. The hesitation in someone’s voice. A text left on read. A joke that didn’t get a laugh.
Little by little, her smile faded.
One evening, her best friend Priya frowned at her. “I miss the old you,” she said. “The one who smiled without overthinking.”
Riya felt a lump in her throat. She hadn’t even realized how much she had changed—how much doubt had stolen from her.
That night, she stood in front of her mirror, trying to smile. At first, it felt stiff, unnatural. But then, as she let go of the weight of overthinking, it started to feel real again.
Moral: Overthinking doesn’t change the past—it only steals the present.

137,,Emotional drama,Drama,The Torn Letter,,ENGLISH,"Aarav had stared at the envelope for weeks. It was from his father—the man who had walked out on him years ago.
He had told himself he didn’t care. That there was nothing his father could say that would make a difference.
But he hadn’t thrown the letter away.
One night, after another long day at work, he sat at his desk, the letter in front of him. With a deep breath, he tore it open.
""I know I hurt you. I wasn’t a good father. But I still hope you’re happy… and I’m proud of the man you’ve become.""
Aarav’s hands trembled. He had carried his anger for so long, believing it gave him strength. But now, reading those words, he realized—he wasn’t holding onto his anger. His anger had been holding onto him.
For the first time in years, he felt the weight begin to lift.
sometimes letting go is the only way forward.

138,,Psychological Drama,Drama,The Cracked Mirror,,ENGLISH,"Rishi stared at his reflection, fractured by a jagged crack running through the bathroom mirror.
“That’s me,” he muttered. “Broken.”
His jaw clenched as memories crashed over him—shouting at his mother when she asked about his day, pushing away friends who tried to help, walking out on his sister’s birthday just because she joked about his temper. Every time he lost control, he told himself he’d do better next time. But next time always looked the same.
Frustrated, he slammed his fist against the sink. The cracked mirror trembled.
The next morning, his sister walked into his room, carrying a brand-new mirror. “Here,” she said simply, placing it on his desk.
Rishi frowned. “I don’t need a new one.”
She shrugged. “Maybe. But maybe this time… you’ll see yourself clearer.”
Her words lingered long after she left. He turned to the new mirror, staring at his reflection—not broken, not distorted. Just him.
For the first time in a long while, he didn’t look away.
Moral: Healing begins when you stop seeing yourself only through your flaws.
"
139,,Inspirational,Drama,The Half-Painted Wall ,,ENGLISH,"Arjun’s apartment wall stood half-painted—one side a deep, bold blue, the other still a plain, lifeless white.
He had started painting weeks ago, excited at first. But then doubt crept in. What if it looks terrible? What if I regret this color?
So he stopped. The half-painted wall became a symbol of his hesitation. Every time he walked by, it reminded him of a decision left hanging.
One day, his friend stopped by and smirked. “You know… it already looks worse than if you’d just finished it.”
That night, Arjun picked up his brush. Stroke by stroke, he covered the last patch of white.
And as he stepped back to admire the finished wall, he realized—the fear of failure had been worse than failing itself.
Moral: Leaving things unfinished doesn’t stop regret—it creates it.
"
140,,Nostalgia,Drama,The Postcard,,ENGLISH,"Maya stood at the edge of the cliff, wind whipping through her hair. The mountains stretched endlessly before her — wild, untamed, and silent.
“You okay?” Kian’s voice broke the quiet. He stood beside her, calm as ever.
“Yeah,” she lied.
They had spent the past week exploring — chasing waterfalls, climbing peaks, sharing stories by the fire. It felt... right. Too right. And now she was leaving.
That night, Maya packed her bag. Just as she zipped it shut, a knock startled her. Kian stood at the door, holding a postcard.
“For the road,” he said, eyes softer than usual.
Maya smiled. “See you around?”
“Maybe,” he said. “Maybe not.”
On the train the next day, curiosity gnawed at her. She pulled out the postcard. On the back was a picture of the very cliff where they stood.
“Thank you for reminding me what it’s like to see the world with wonder.” , said the postcard.
Maya stared at it for a long time. She never saw Kian again — but somehow, she knew he’d be okay. And somehow... so would she.
Moral: Real strength isn’t proving you’re fearless—it’s knowing when to walk away.

141,,Psychological Drama,Drama,The Ledge,,ENGLISH,"The rooftop stretched wide beneath the evening sky. Music pulsed from a speaker, blending with laughter as a group gathered near the edge.
Aman stood among them, his back tense.
“Come on, just one step,” someone smirked.
“Yeah, the ledge isn’t even that high,” another voice chimed in.
Aman stared at the narrow edge. It wasn’t a huge drop—maybe ten feet—but there was no rail, no safety. His heart pounded against his ribs.
“What’s the matter?” a voice teased. “Scared?”
His fingers twitched. If I don’t do it, they’ll laugh... if I do it, I might fall.
He imagined his foot slipping, the air rushing past him, the moment he’d realize he had no control.
“No thanks,” Aman muttered, stepping back.
A ripple of laughter followed him as he walked away, but the tightness in his chest eased. The city lights stretched before him, and for the first time that night, he felt like he could breathe.
Moral: Breaking free doesn’t mean never struggling—it’s choosing to fight even when you feel weak."
142,,Addiction,Drama,The Burning Candle,,ENGLISH,"The candle’s flame flickered, casting shadows against the dimly lit room.
Rohan sat on his bed, staring at the half-empty bottle on his table. He couldn’t even remember when he started drinking this often—just a glass after work… then two… then three.
I can stop anytime, he told himself. But tonight, his hands shook without it. His chest felt heavy, his thoughts spiraled.
The candle wavered again—small, fragile, barely holding on.
Just one drink, he thought. Just to calm down.
He reached for the bottle, fingers wrapping around the cold glass. The weight of it felt familiar, comforting.
Then, with a deep breath, he stood up. Slowly, he walked to the sink and tilted the bottle over. The liquid splashed against the drain, disappearing.
The candle still flickered… but it hadn’t gone out.
Moral: Breaking free doesn’t mean never struggling—it’s choosing to fight even when you feel weak."
143,,Family and Emotional conflict,Drama,The Vanishing Act,,ENGLISH,"The music pounded in Aryan’s ears as he wandered through the crowded party. People danced, shouted, and drowned in laughter, but his phone buzzed again—his dad’s texts lighting up the screen.
""Where are you?""
 ""Come home.""
Aryan clenched his jaw and shoved his phone deep into his pocket. He didn’t want to be home—not tonight.
Hours later, he stumbled out into the cold night air. The streets were empty, too quiet. He pulled out his phone, hesitated, then finally dialed.
It rang. And rang. No answer.
His chest tightened.
By the time he reached home, his dad was waiting at the door—arms crossed, face unreadable.
“I thought you’d left for good,” his dad said quietly.
Aryan swallowed hard. “I thought you wouldn’t care,” he whispered.
Neither was true… and they both knew it.
Moral: Running away doesn’t make problems disappear—sometimes, it just makes the silence louder."
144,,Fear,Suspense,The Forgotten Phone,,ENGLISH,"The café buzzed with quiet chatter and the soft clinking of coffee cups. Alisha scrolled through her phone, absentmindedly waiting for her friend.
At the next table, a man in a grey hoodie tapped his fingers on the table, glancing at her every few moments.
Alisha’s stomach tightened. Why does he keep staring?
Her fingers gripped her phone tighter as scenarios flashed through her mind. Is he following me? Does he want something?
Then her phone buzzed. She jumped, heart racing. A message from her friend:
""Sorry, stuck in traffic. Be there soon.""
As she exhaled, the man in the hoodie stood up. He walked straight toward her.
Her breath caught.
“You forgot this.”
He placed her wallet—the one she hadn’t even realized was missing—on her table and gave a small nod before walking away.
She sat frozen, then let out a nervous laugh.
Moral: Sometimes, fear creates problems that never existed.
"
145,,Regret,Drama,Broken Mirror,,ENGLISH,"The apartment reeked of stale air and unwashed dishes. Crumpled papers littered the floor, and a shattered mirror glistened near the corner. Manish sat on his bed, clutching his phone. No messages. No calls. His girlfriend had blocked him after their fight.
He replayed the argument in his mind — her voice breaking as she stormed out. Manish had shouted back, words sharp and reckless. Now there was nothing but silence.
Frustration boiled over — he hurled his phone across the room. It clattered against the wall and slid under the bed.
A faint vibration caught his attention. His phone... it was ringing. He crawled across the floor and reached under the bed. As his fingers closed around the phone, the screen flickered:
Missed Call – Mom.
His hand trembled. She had tried calling earlier, but he ignored it — too caught up in his anger. His chest ached with something heavier than frustration.
He looked back at the shattered mirror. In its reflection, his face stared back — tired, worn... and afraid.
He clutched his phone tightly, then pressed Call Back.
Moral: Anger tends to blind you towards the people who still care for you
"
146,,pyschological thriller,Horror,The Flickering Light,,ENGLISH,"Riya always avoided long drives at night... but tonight was different. She needed to clear her head.
The highway stretched endlessly ahead. Streetlights flickered, one after another, until darkness swallowed the road. She gripped the wheel tighter, forcing herself to focus.
Moments later, a figure appeared near a bridge — motionless, staring. Riya’s foot hovered over the brake, but the figure vanished before she could react.
Her heart raced. She checked her mirrors. Nothing.
A minute later, the figure reappeared — this time beside the road sign. Same face. Same stare. Riya’s knuckles turned white against the steering wheel.
Then she glanced in her rearview mirror — and froze. The same figure... was now behind her car, watching.
""I knew you'd run again,"" a voice echoed in her head. The lights flickered back on — and he was gone.
She reached home, locked her doors, and sat in silence. The flickering streetlight outside seemed to blink in rhythm — one flash, then two... the pattern Arjun always used to tap her wrist when he teased her.
Moral: Running away doesn’t erase the things you leave behind.
"
147,,Emotional conflict,Drama,The Unfinished Letter,,ENGLISH,"Raghav slouched at his desk, staring at the half-written page in front of him.
""Dear Dad...""
That was all he had written.
The pen felt heavy in his hand. He exhaled sharply and crumpled the paper, tossing it aside. Another failed attempt.
His mind swirled with memories—his father’s harsh words, the constant criticism, the tension that had filled their home for years. Resentment sat like a stone in his chest. Why should I even bother?
But then, his eyes drifted to an old photograph on the table—his father, laughing, his arm draped over Raghav’s shoulder. He remembered the late-night chess games, the inside jokes, the warmth that had once existed between them.
Something inside him ached.
He picked up his pen, hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath.
This time, he didn’t stop at “Dear Dad.”
""I know we haven’t spoken in a while... but I think it’s time we should.""
Moral: Pride can silence words you’ll later wish you’d said.
